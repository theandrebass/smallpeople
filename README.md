# Small People 🌏

**[Small People](https://smallpeople.vercel.app/)** is a weekend hack inspired by [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVETyGQK2c-/). It's an customizable little sandbox world with small people and their small conversations. Play with it at [smallpeople.vercel.app](https://smallpeople.vercel.app).

Small People is written entirely in JavaScript. It renders everything using basic 2D Canvas APIs, and uses a custom algorithm to generate humans and their shadows.

## Build and deploy

- **Run a server.** Small People is a static single-page app. Use any web server (like `node-static` or `python -m http.Server`) to serve the project directory. I use `python -m http.Server 10009` and go to `localhost:10009`.
- **Build the program.** The entire source code for Small People is in `bundle.js`. `bundle.js` is the pre-compiled javascript file which the app loads.
